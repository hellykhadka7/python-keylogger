# Keylogger Tool Using Python

##  Project Aim
To create a basic keylogger tool that captures and logs keystrokes on a device for educational purposes.

##  Description
The tool logs all user keystrokes and saves them to a local text file. It can be used to study:
- How input is captured at the system level
- Event-driven programming using Python libraries

> ⚠️ This tool was built strictly for academic purposes to understand keyboard event capturing. It should not be used for any malicious activity.

##  Tools Used
- Python
- `pynput` library (for listening to keystrokes)

## Output
All keystrokes are recorded and stored in a log file.

## 📝 Notes
Completed independently with AI guidance to understand event listeners and input capture.
